        <b>‚ú™ What is an NFT?</b>

      <div>
      NFTs or non-fungible tokens, are cryptographic assets on blockchain with unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from each other. NFTs are unique and not mutually interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. NFTs can be a unique digital artwork, sneaker in a limited-run fashion line, in-game item, digital collectible etc.

        <b>‚ú™ What makes an NFT valuable?</b>
      </div>
      <div>„Ö§</div>
      <div>
      The value of an NFT comes from the property it represents, which is generally something that exists in the digital world like an original piece of art or digital memorabilia. The NFT itself doesn‚Äôt necessarily contain the digital property, but points to its location on the blockchain.

      </div>
      <div>„Ö§</div>
      <div>
      Traditional works of art such as paintings are valuable because they are one of a kind. But digital files can be easily and endlessly duplicated. With NFTs, artwork can be ‚Äútokenised‚Äù to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought and sold. As with crypto-currency, a record of who owns what is stored on a shared ledger known as the blockchain. The records cannot be forged because the ledger is maintained by thousands of computers around the world.

      <div>
      NFTs aren‚Äôt cryptocurrencies, but they are built using technology similar to Ethereum and Bitcoin. Also, like cryptocurrencies, NFTs exist on a blockchain, which verifies their unique identity and ownership. The blockchain also keeps a record of all the transactions connected to the NFT and the property it represents.
